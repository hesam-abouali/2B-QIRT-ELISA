The code in this repository, uses NumPy,SciPy and pandas libraries to facilitate data analyis in a real-time continuous multiplexed ELISA assay. 
The quantum dot integrated real-time (QIRT)-ELISA system, benefits from a bead-based quantum dot-mediated immunoassay (BQI) 
to continuously monitor insulin and glucagon in whole blood samples. 

This code has been implemented into an Streamlit framework to faciltate an accessible approach to use the QIRT-ELISA system for rapid and real-time measurements.
